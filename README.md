## About Me:
I am a historian-in-training at UC Berkeley, and I am interested in Public History and the History of Ideas. I want to use the tools of Digital Humanities to research, analyze, and share interesting data about how ideas become popular. For this project, more specifically, I want to see if there is evidence of how America embarked on the New Deal mindset. 

## From Liberalism to the New Deal in Language
When FDR became president in 1933, he encountered a nation that had nosedived into despair. The Great Depression was entering its fourth year, and the unemployment rate was at 24.9%, the highest in the country's history. Around 26,000 businesses failed. Stock prices plummeted. It transformed American life.

His predecessor Herbert Hoover had been elected only one year before the market crash. A classic liberal, Hoover believed that economic downturns were part of a capitalist economy and were to be expected. As he said in a speech in 1931, government assistance weakened the American character. Hoover hoped that the solution to the Depression would come from voluntary aid and "associational action" by community members and business people and by maintaining a positive mind frame, often making public statements that "the tide had turned." In the eyes of many Americans, President Hoover's response seemed inadequate and uncaring. His nineteen-century approach to Liberalism no longer served the nation's needs, and FDR's New Deal marked the beginning of a new relationship between Americans and their government. 

My project seeks to find linguist evidence of this sentimental shift between Hoover's Liberalism and FDR's New Deal. I want to do so by analyzing FDR's Fireside Chats, a series of 27 speeches transmitted by radio where the president communicated directly with the people, and Hoover's speeches from the start of the Depression until he leaves office. By analyzing the most frequently used words, sentiment, and topics of the speeches, I hope to find what made one so comforting while the other seemed so out of touch.
